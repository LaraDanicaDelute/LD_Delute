            <p class = "educ">In Highschool that is when my interest in Technology <br> 
                and design grew, I started learning basic HTML-CSS. <br>
            <br>
            In my 2 years of senior high-school I designed layouts on various <br> 
            projects and also video for a class project.<br>
            <br>
            Finally in College, I enrolled  as a Information Technology freshman,<br>
            in my first year (2019) of college it was tough as I was still adjusting <br>
             but I managed to be on the dean's lister.</p>

            <p class = "achievements"> I graduated High-School and Senior High-School <br>
                without any awards but still for me it is considered an achievement and <br>
                a step closer to my goals. <br>
                <br>

                department which is for me it is a big achievment, Lastly I completed <br>
