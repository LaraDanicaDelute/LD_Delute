                <li>1) Hidilyn Diaz is the fifth of six children of Eduardo and Emelita Diaz. 
                    Her father was a tricycle driver before becoming a farmer and a fisherman. 
                    She grew up wanting to be a banker and trying several sports, like basketball 
                    and volleyball. Her cousin, Allen Jayfrus Diaz, taught her the basics of 
                    weightlifting</li>
                <li>2)She attended the Universidad de Zamboanga where she pursued a bachelor's 
                     in computer science. However, Diaz stopped attending the university as a 
                     third year irregular student as she found her degree unsuitable for her. 
                     She also claimed that it distracted her training. After her success in the 
                     2016 Olympics, Diaz decided to continue her tertiary education and intended 
                     to pursue a degree related to sports in Manila</li>
                <li>3)In January 2017, Diaz received a scholarship to study business management at De 
                    La Salle-College of Saint Benilde. In 2019, Diaz went on a leave of absence for her 
                    schooling as she had focused on Olympic Preparation after winning the Asian Games.
                    In 2020, Diaz had re-enrolled into online classes since the Summer Olympics had been 
                    postponed to July 2021.</li>

                    making her the first Filipino woman to compete for the country, despite being placed second 
                    to last she was praised for her performance."</li>
                <li>2) In 2016 Summer Olympics,Diaz competed in the women's 53 kilogram weightlifting category

                <ul class="py-4">
                    <li>Diaz's achievements at the 2020 Summer Olympics were remarkable, as she was previously 
                        stranded in Malaysia from February 2020 until July 2021, due to travel restrictions 
                        imposed by governments to contain the COVID-19 pandemic. Based on guidance by her coach,
                         Gao Kaiwen, Diaz initially went to train in Malaysia in February 2020 because Gao though
                         t it would be better for her as she focused on qualifying for Tokyo. However, once Malaysia
                          implemented its Movement Control Order in April 2020, which closed gyms within the capital 
                          region of Kuala Lumpur (Klang Valley), she improvised by using bamboo sticks and large 
                          water bottles as makeshift weightlifting equipment</li>
                    <li>In October 2020, she relocated to the southern coastal state of Malacca where they have been
                         living in a house owned by a Malaysian weightlifting official in Jasin.However, the Malaysian
                          government later implemented periodic restrictions on gyms and sporting activities within 2021
                        (to reduce social interaction and contain the spread of the coronavirus), forcing her to work out
                         in the house's sweltering open-air carport in the immediate months prior to the 2020 Summer 
                         Olympics.</li>      
                    <li>Diaz also fought mental breakdown during her ordeal, especially with the postponement of the 
                        2020 Olympics, and credits her team, including sports psychologist Dr. Karen Katrina Trinidad 
                        and Project: Steady with trauma therapist Gang Badoy Capati for her well-being. She also kept 
                        busy during her training overseas during COVID-19 lockdown by cooking, attending meetings, and
                         studying</li>
                   <li>In recognition of winning the first gold medal for the Philippines at any Olympic Games, 
                       she was awarded PHP 35.5 million (approximately US$660,000) along with a house and a lot. 
                       The financial and asset awards, were jointly given by both the national government and tycoons
                        from the private sector.[55] Under Philippine law, the Philippine Sports Commission guarantees
                         a 10 million-peso incentive for every Olympic gold medal per Republic Act 10699.</li>
