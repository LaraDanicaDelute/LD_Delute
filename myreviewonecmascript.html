        <h2>Brief History</h2>
        <p>In the 90's therewere various of scripting languages and developers struggled to <br> 
        support each and apply to their web, to bring stability Netscape submitted <br> JavaScript
        to ECMA international to define standards to be implemented <br> and shared with other browser vendors,
        so they released ECMA Script in June of 1997.</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <h2>What is ECMA Script</h2>
        <p>ECMA script is a standard that scripting languages such as JavaScript follows,<br>
        it is to asure the interoperability of webpages between different browsers.</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <h2>Review</h2>
        <p>I have learned that even though scripting languages may differ in so many ways,<br>
        they still have to follow the standards implemented, just like car companies,<br>
        their cars may differ in appearances and model but they function <br>
        the same as the other cars and they are used also the same.</p>
